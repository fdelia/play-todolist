# Code from Scala todolist tutorial

To Play 2.4.x updated code from the [Scala todolist tutorial](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0.4/ScalaTodoList). The tutorial was written for Play 2.0.x and since then some parts have changed. That's why some lines have been added to the code. The added lines are marked with `new`.

Furthermore I added Bootstrap to make it look better.

## Instructions

* Clone the project into local system
* To run the Play framework 2.4.x, you need JDK 8 or later
* Install Typesafe Activator if you do not have it already. You can get it from [here](http://www.playframework.com/download)
* Execute `activator clean compile` to build the product
* Execute `activator run` to execute the product
* Todolist should now be accessible at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
